# Introduction to Rebugger

Rebugger is an expression-level debugger for Julia.
It has no ability to interact with or manipulate call stacks (see [ASTInterpreter2](https://github.com/Keno/ASTInterpreter2.jl)),
but it can trace execution via the manipulation of Julia expressions.

The name "Rebugger" has 3 meanings:

- it is a [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/REPL/)-based debugger (more on that below)
- it is the [Revise](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl)-based debugger
- it supports repeated-execution "surface" debugging

Rebugger is an unusual debugger with a novel work-flow paradigm.
With most debuggers, you enter some special mode that lets the user "dive into the code,"
but what you are allowed to do while in this special mode may be limited.
In contrast, Rebugger brings the code along with its input arguments to the user,
presenting them both for inspection, analysis, and editing in the (mostly) normal Julia
interactive command line.
As a consequence, you can:

- test different modifications to the code or arguments without being forced to exit debug mode
  and save your file
- run the same chosen block of code repeatedly (perhaps with different modifications each time)
  without having to repeat any of the "setup" work that might have been necessary to get to some
  deeply nested method in the original call stack.
  In other words, Rebugger brings "internal" methods to the surface.
- run any desired command that helps you understand the nature of a bug.
  For example, if you've already loaded `MyFavoritePlottingPackage` in your session,
  then when debugging you can (transiently) add `Main.MyFavoritePlottingPackage.plot(x, y)`
  as a line of the method-body you are currently analyzing, and you should see a
  plot of the requested variables.

Rebugger exploits the Julia REPL's history capabilities to simulate the
stacktrace-navigation features of graphical debuggers.
Thus Rebugger offers a command-line experience that is more closely aligned with
graphical debuggers than the traditional `s`, `n`, `up`, `c` commands of a console debugger.

## Installation and configuration

Begin with

```julia
(v1.0) pkg> add Rebugger
```

You can experiment with Rebugger with just

```julia
julia> using Rebugger
```

If you decide you like it (see [Usage](@ref)), you can optionally configure it so that it
is always available (see [Configuration](@ref)).

## Note for Ubuntu users

The default meta key on Ubuntu is left Alt, which is equivalent to Esc Alt on the default Gnome terminal emulator. 

### Ubuntu 16.04

Rebugger may not work with the default keyboard shortucts on Ubuntu 16.04. The root of the issue is not solved yet. As a walkaround please re-map the meta keys to function keys, e.g. adding to `startup.jl`

```
    Rebugger.keybindings[:stepin] = "\e[17~"      # Add the keybinding F6 to step into a function.
    Rebugger.keybindings[:stacktrace] = "\e[18~"  # Add the keybinding F7 to capture a stacktrace.
``` 
as stated in the [Customize keybindings](@ref) section to map step-in to F6 and stacktrace to F7.
